# data_vis_templates

Toolkit is put in place to provide ready to use python templates for common data visualisation charts.  Templates are provided as examples and can be readily modified as required for purpose.

All charts are designed using the best practice principles explored by Cole Knafflic in her book [Storytelling with Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/).

General principles used in the visualisations are as follows:

Style
 - Clutter is minimised on the chart canvas and draw focus to the most important data features
    - Important features are as close to the top left of a designated chart area as possible as this is where a reader will first concentrate
    - Non-necessary features are removed from the chart (additional spines, grid lines etc.)
    - Chart legends are kept basic with label and colour used only

Colour
 - Colour palettes are kept as basic as possible to avoid distraction from the key chart information
    - Grey scale used with saturated colour highlighting primary data of interest
    - Improves accessibility for colour blind users
    - Allows easy reproducibility multiple presentation formats (presentation, printing etc.)
